* Of those retirees, a majority of them are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, as shown in this chart above.
* Additionally, there are about 1,500 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.
* Only 2 managers are close to retirement. 


## Summary
With over 70,000 upcoming retirees, Pewlett Hackard should take advantage of their mentorship program to train the regular and junior level roles. Rather than solely relying on their talent acquisition to replace all these employees, this would be a great opportunity for the company to grow their current staff into senior level roles. This would boost employee morale.

Unfortunately, there are only 1,500 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This chart above shows their makeup. The company should consider bringing in a Learning & Development team or consultant to help prepare other senior employees to mentor, as this list is not enough to make up for the number of employees who will soon be retiring. 

A great advantage to our research has showed that only 2 managers are close to retirement. This means that the organization can focus on training employees technically, rather than on people management skills. That would require more resources. 

### Other Focuses

While it is important for the company to replace those roles that are leaving due to retirement, they should also focus on retention. If any more of their current employees leave the organization for reasons other than retirement, the company would be facing a huge headcount issue. This chart above shows the total number of male and female employees in the company. If the company were to remain competitive, they should do a deep dive analysis on their salaries (to make sure they're at market rate) and place some resources in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The current male to female employee ratio is alarming.
